# Day 24: flex-shrink calculation

This is another optional knowledge. But if you're like me and are about curious how the browser calculates flex-shrink. Join me in this rabbit hole üê∞

The math behind flex-shrink is a bit more complicated then flex-grow. You need to take into account of it's existing proportion and shrink it accordingly to the flex shrink amount. Hence, a few more calculation involved. Again, if this is throwing you off. Skip it. You don't need to know this to understand Flexbox. Luckily the browser takes care of it for you, how wonderful üòå

## Calculation

Indeed the calculation is a bit more complicated. But no worries, let's break it down we go through it step by step, you got this üí™

Here's the `HTML` and `CSS` we're working with:

_HTML_

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="green"></div>
  <div class="yellow"></div>
</div>
```

_CSS_

```css
.parent {
  width: 800px;
}
.green {
  width: 300px;
  flex-shrink: 4;
}
.yellow {
  width: 600px;
  flex-shrink: 6;
}
```

### Step 1: Breaking down the variables

This is the formula:

```code
new width = width - (shrink space x shrink ratio)
```

Let's extract the variables required in the formula to this handy table we can fill in as we go:

| Variables    |                     |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| width        | _need to calculate_ |
| shrink space | _need to calculate_ |
| shrink ratio | _need to calculate_ |

### Step 2: Fill in what we know

From the `CSS` value, we can conclude the following:

- The parent element (container) has a width of `800`
- Green child element has a width `300` and `flex-shrink` of `4`
- Yellow child element has a width `600` and `flex-shrink` of `6`

Let's update our chart with this information:

|             | Green | Yellow |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| flex shrink | 4     | 6      |
| width       | 300   | 600    |

### Step 3: Calculate "shrunk space"

This is the formula:

```code
shrunk space = total children widths - parent width
```

Remember what we know:

- The parent element (container) has a width of `800`
- The child elements has a width of `300`, `600`

Great, we can use that information to calculate "total children widths":

```code
total children widths = green + yellow
                      = 300   + 600

=> 900
```

Now we can calculate our "shrunk space":

```code
shrunk space = total children widths - parent width
             = 900                   -  800

=> 100
```

Let's update our chart and add the additional information:

|              | Green | Yellow | Total   |
| ------------ | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| flex shrink  | 4     | 6      |
| width        | 300   | 600    |
| shrunk space | -     | -      | **100** |

### Step 4: Calculate "shrink ratio"

This is the formula:

```code
shrink ratio = (width x flex shrink) / total shrink scaled width
```

Notice this new variable, `total shrink scaled width`. So we need to calculate that first to get our shrink ratio.

#### Step 4-1: Calculate "total shrink scaled width"

This is the formula:

```code
total shrink scaled width = Œ£(width x flex shrink)
```

"Œ£" Sigma is a math symbol that means the summation of something. So we need to apply `width x flex shrink` for all the child elements.

_Green_

```code
width x flex shrink = 300 x 4

=> 1200
```

_Yellow_

```code
width x flex shrink = 600 x 6

=> 3600
```

_Finally_

```code
total shrink scaled width = 1200 + 3600

=> 4800
```

Let's add this information to our chart:

|                           | Green | Yellow | Total    |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| flex shrink               | 4     | 6      |
| width                     | 300   | 600    |
| shrunk space              | -     | -      | 100      |
| total shrink scaled width | -     | -      | **4800** |

#### Step 4-2: Back to calculating "shrink ratio"

Fantastic, now that we know the "total shrink scaled width", we can return with calculating the "shrink ratio". Remember the formula:

```code
shrink ratio = (width x flex shrink) / total shrink scaled width
```

_Green_

```code
shrink ratio = (300 x 4) / 4800

=> 0.25
```

_Yellow_

```code
shrink ratio = (600 x 6) / 4800

=> 0.75
```

Let's add this information to our chart:

|              | Green    | Yellow   | Total |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | ----- |
| flex shrink  | 4        | 6        |
| width        | 300      | 600      |
| shrunk space | -        | -        | 100   |
| shrink ratio | **0.25** | **0.75** |

### Final step: Calculate "new width"

Remember the formula:

```code
new width = width - (shrink space x shrink ratio)
```

_Green_

```code
new width = 300 - (100 x 0.25)

=> 275
```

_Yellow_

```code
new width = 600 - (100 x 0.75)

=> 525
```

Done! We have successfully calculated the new width ü•≥

|               | Green   | Yellow  |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| width         | 300     | 600     |
| shrunk space  | 4       | 6       |
| shrink ratio  | 0.25    | 0.75    |
| **new width** | **275** | **525** |
